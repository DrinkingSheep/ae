MultiByteToWideChar
  ~ Determining required buffer size ~
  Returns a number of wide characters (not bytes!), including one extra #0-character. This means that for an empty string this func will return 1 (1 * sizeof(widechar) = 2).
  If it was used to actually convert strings, returns a number of characters written (including #0-char).

  ~ Converting ~
  Writes a converted string plus #0-char.
  

GetOpenFileName (= GetSaveFileName)
  ~ lpstrFile ~
  Before invoking a dialog can be used to set a default file name. Cannot be used to set multiple selection of default files (won't work as expected).
  
  After the dialog func returns, this field is set according to what user has selected:
  * if it was a single file, it'll be just a PWideChar with that file name.
  * if multiselect was enabled AND user has selected more than one file, this field is set to chain of PWideChar's, in the following order: DIRECTORY#0FILE_1#0FILE_2#0... #0#0, where FILE_N is file's base name (without path).
    *  Btw, DIRECTORY in multiselection isn't necessary followed by '\', as I've noticed, it's followed by this only if files were selected in the root of some drive.
    * However, if Wide version of the dialog func is used, single #0 is replaced with #00#00 (and double #0 with #0#0#0#0).
  
  The same pattern applies to lpstrFilter: NAME#0MASK#0NAME#0MASK#0... #0#0. Wide version need #0-chars doubled.


lstrlenw
  Returns a number of characters without terminating #0-char. That is, to get a size in bytes of a PWideChar it's needed to do: lstrlen(Str) * 2 + 2.
